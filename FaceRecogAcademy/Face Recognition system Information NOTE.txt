# Face Recognition system , Attendance System.


Hi guys Have a look at amazing Face recognition system we have 
developed. Model is capable of detecting multiple faces at a time.
Here system is able to detect the face in video shown in mobile phone screen!

**MTCNN is one of the best algorithm for facial detection problem 
statements in computer vision**

It has no compairison with hardcoded xml based algorithm like #Harcascade.
Harcascade is too old and worst approach in todays world.



##Three_main_Tasks_of_MTCNN are.

I) classification between face and nonface
ll) Bounding Box Regression
lll) Facial Landmark Localization


 

1) It's mainly responcible for creating the exact squre marking around the 
face while capturing picture or frames of video.

2) MTCNN Plays important role in neglecting non-necessary Stuff inside images.
Its focusses on face only and neglect background,body etc which leads to saving 
heavy non necessary computation.

3) To build attendance systems like project it is very useful.

4) There are five landmarks:
l)left eye,
ll)right eye,
lll)nose,
lV)left mouth corner and
V)right mouth corner.
